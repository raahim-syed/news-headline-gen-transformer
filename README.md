## Installation

To get started, you need to set up the environment. Follow these steps to install the required dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-headline-generation.git
    cd news-headline-generation
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the dataset:**
    - This project uses a dataset from Kaggle. Ensure you have Kaggle API installed and set up. Run the following command to download the dataset:
    ```python
    kaggle datasets download -d YOUR_DATASET_NAME
    ```

## Usage

Follow these steps to generate headlines:

1. **Run the Jupyter notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Headline_Generation_Transformer.ipynb
    ```

2. **Upload and preprocess the dataset:**
    - The notebook includes cells to load and preprocess the dataset. Ensure you run all cells sequentially.

3. **Generate headlines:**
    - Paste your news article into the provided cell in the notebook, and the model will generate potential headlines for your story.

## Dataset

This project uses a dataset that consists of numerous news articles and their corresponding headlines. The dataset is preprocessed to remove any anomalies and to standardize the format for better model performance.

## Model

The headline generation model is based on Transformer architecture, which is highly effective for natural language processing tasks. The model training includes the following steps:

- **Data Exploration:** Understanding the dataset distribution.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing data for training.
- **Model Training:** Using a Transformer model to learn from the data.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance on unseen data.

## Results

The model demonstrates high accuracy and fluency in generating headlines that are relevant to the input news articles. Below are some example outputs:

- **Input:** "Global markets are experiencing a significant downturn due to rising inflation."
  - **Generated Headline:** "Markets Plunge as Inflation Worries Mount Globally"

- **Input:** "The new policy reforms aim to improve the educational standards across the country."
  - **Generated Headline:** "New Policy Reforms Set to Boost National Education Standards"
